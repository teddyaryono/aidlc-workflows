# Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy

Scopes control **which stages execute**. Depth controls **how much detail** each stage produces. Test strategy controls **how many tests** are generated. Together, they adapt the lifecycle to your task — from a comprehensive enterprise feature to a quick bugfix.

This chapter is the detailed routing reference. If you are choosing what kind
of workflow to run, start with [Workflow Profiles](workflow-profiles.md), where
the same scopes are explained in user-facing terms.

## The 11 Core Scopes

Core ships 11 named scopes. Each scope defines a stage set, a default depth level, and a default Change Control value (strict on `enterprise`, `security-patch`, and `infra`; relaxed on the rest; see [Change Control](13-customization.md#change-control) for what the value does and how to set it). Plugin installs can add more scopes, and an install can narrow which plugin scopes are visible with `aidlc engine plugin select <names>`. When a `plugins` selection disables core (`aidlc` omitted), the core scope files remain installed but are not valid runtime scopes until core is re-enabled; the Initialization stages still run for every enabled scope.

### enterprise

**Use when:** Building a regulated enterprise feature that requires full audit trail, compliance review, and production-grade operations.

- **Stages:** All 33
- **Default depth:** Comprehensive
- **Includes:** Full compliance, security, and operations stages

### feature

**Use when:** Building a new feature of any size with the full 33-stage lifecycle. Select it explicitly with `--scope feature` or `/aidlc-feature`.

- **Stages:** All 33
- **Default depth:** Standard
- **Includes:** All stages, standard artifact detail

### mvp

**Use when:** Building a greenfield minimum viable product. Skips late-stage operations but retains full design and construction.

- **Stages:** 23 of 33
- **Default depth:** Standard
- **Skips:** All 7 Operation stages (deployment pipeline, environment provisioning, deployment execution, observability, incident response, performance validation, feedback) plus Market Research, Team Formation, and Approval Handoff from Ideation (10 skipped, 23 executed)

### poc

**Use when:** Proving feasibility quickly. Skips most Ideation and Inception stages, focuses on getting to code fast.

- **Stages:** 8 of 33
- **Default depth:** Minimal
- **Skips:** Market Research, Feasibility, Team Formation, Mockups, User Stories, most Operation stages

### bugfix

**Use when:** Fixing a specific bug. Streamlined path from intent capture through code generation and testing.

- **Stages:** 9 of 33
- **Default depth:** Minimal
- **Includes:** Deployment Pipeline and Deployment Execution so the verified fix ships
- **Skips:** Market Research, Feasibility, Team Formation, Mockups, most design and architecture stages, environment provisioning, and broader operational readiness

### refactor

**Use when:** Cleaning up or restructuring existing code without changing functionality.

- **Stages:** 10 of 33
- **Default depth:** Minimal
- **Includes:** Functional Design plus Deployment Pipeline and Deployment Execution
- **Skips:** Similar to bugfix — focused on code analysis, design, implementation, and deployment through the existing path

### infra

**Use when:** Making infrastructure changes (new environments, CDK/CloudFormation updates, cost optimization).

- **Stages:** 13 of 33
- **Default depth:** Standard
- **Skips:** User-facing stages (stories, mockups, user flows) — focuses on architecture, infrastructure, and deployment

### security-patch

**Use when:** Responding to a CVE or security vulnerability. Fast path through security-relevant stages.

- **Stages:** 10 of 33
- **Default depth:** Minimal
- **Skips:** Market Research, Team Formation, Mockups, non-security design stages

### classic

**Use when:** You want v1-style ceremony: Inception and Construction, with one human approval per stage. Conditional stages adapt to the project at runtime; Operation remains a placeholder. Stage-declared execution modes and support agents are unchanged.

- **Stages:** 18 of 33
- **Default depth:** Standard
- **Default test strategy:** Standard
- **Skips:** All Ideation stages (1.1-1.7), CI Pipeline (3.7), and all Operation stages (4.1-4.7)
- **Keywords:** None; selected explicitly or used as the implicit default
- **Ceremony:** Walking skeleton and summary confirmation off. Sensors run and the learnings ritual runs. Reviews are advisory (one pass per stage, findings at the approval gate); explicit autonomy keeps the single pre-merge review.

Override ceremonies for an intent with `/aidlc --sensors on|off`, `/aidlc --learnings on|off`, or `/aidlc --summary-confirmation on|off`. The global kill switches `AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1`, `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS=1`, and `AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION=1` force them off. Approval gates, Plan Approval, human-turn authority, audit, and team write protection still apply. See [ceremony customization](13-customization.md#ceremony-switches).

#### Upgrading an in-flight classic intent

The saved stage plan is preserved: an older classic intent whose Operation
stages are recorded as `EXECUTE` still runs them, and routing, next-stage lookup,
and status follow that recorded plan. New classic intents use the smaller grid.
Ceremony defaults change immediately when the old intent has no saved ceremony
fields: Sensors and Learnings resolve to `on`, while Summary Confirmation
resolves to `off` from classic. Enable summary confirmation with
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts config-change --summary-confirmation on`
(native: `aidlc engine config set summary-confirmation on`).
Saved per-intent ceremony choices remain in effect.
Environment kill switches still take precedence.

Classic's reviewer cap also changes immediately: every reviewer-bearing stage
runs one advisory pass, and `--review adversarial` cannot raise that cap
(`--review none` still lowers it). To run the previous classic graph, with CI
Pipeline and the Operation stages, change the intent to workshop with
`aidlc engine scope change --scope workshop`; workshop retains the full
Inception-through-Operation plan and uses a Minimal test strategy by default.
Preserve a production Standard test strategy if needed by adding
`--test-strategy standard` to that scope change.

### workshop

**Use when:** Running a facilitated workshop or training lab with the established
full Inception-through-Operation lifecycle and a lighter teaching test floor.

- **Stages:** 26 of 33
- **Default depth:** Standard
- **Default test strategy:** Minimal
- **Skips:** All Ideation stages (1.1-1.7)
- **Keywords:** `workshop`, `lab`, and `training`

### express

**Use when:** You want the lightest path from requirements through code and test to a conditional deploy tail, with no design pass or reviewer dispatch.

- **Stages:** 10 of 33
- **Default depth:** Minimal
- **Review cap:** None
- **Includes:** Initialization, conditional Reverse Engineering, Requirements Analysis, Code Generation, Build and Test, and the conditional Deployment Pipeline, Deployment Execution, and Observability Setup stages
- **Skips:** Ideation, design, Units Generation, Delivery Planning, CI Pipeline, environment provisioning, and the late operations stages

## Scope Routing Table

Authoritative data lives in the `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` files (scope identity), plugin scope files, plus each stage's `scopes:` frontmatter (membership), compiled into `.claude/tools/data/scope-grid.json`. The compiled grid contains only scopes enabled by the current plugin selection. Run `aidlc engine gen scope-table` for the live compiled table (and `aidlc engine orchestrate help` for the user-facing workflow and scope one-liners).

| Scope | EXECUTE / Total | Depth | Test Strategy | Use Case |
|-------|-----------------|-------|---------------|----------|
| `enterprise` | 33 / 33 | Comprehensive | Comprehensive | Regulated enterprise feature, full audit trail |
| `feature` | 33 / 33 | Standard | Standard | Full lifecycle for new features |
| `mvp` | 23 / 33 | Standard | Standard | Greenfield, skip late operations |
| `poc` | 8 / 33 | Minimal | Minimal | Prove feasibility fast |
| `bugfix` | 9 / 33 | Minimal | Minimal | Fix and deploy a specific bug |
| `refactor` | 10 / 33 | Minimal | Minimal | Clean up and deploy existing code |
| `infra` | 13 / 33 | Standard | Standard | Infrastructure change |
| `security-patch` | 10 / 33 | Minimal | Minimal | CVE response |
| `classic` | 18 / 33 | Standard | Standard | V1-style Inception + Construction — the implicit default |
| `workshop` | 26 / 33 | Standard | Minimal | Facilitated lifecycle with teaching-oriented tests |
| `express` | 10 / 33 | Minimal | Minimal | Requirements to conditional deploy, no design or reviewers |
| (auto-detect) | Varies | Varies | Varies | AI determines from freeform intent |

Scopes differ by an order of magnitude in ceremony: `poc` runs a narrow single-pass path, while `feature` runs all 33 stages with 29 gates and five design stages that fan out per Unit of Work in Construction. The scope confirmation line names the effective numbers - stage count, approval-gate count, and any per-unit fan-out - computed from the compiled grid and workspace scan, never estimated. Greenfield work excludes reverse engineering, and scopes that skip `units-generation` omit the per-unit clause because no Unit DAG exists. You know what you are consenting to before the workflow starts.

The confirmation also lists what the effective policy turns off, including creation flags and environment kill switches. Classic defaults add `; no summary confirmation`; opting summary confirmation in removes the clause, because an advisory review cap is not a disabled ceremony. Scopes with every ceremony enabled and no `none` review cap omit that clause.

> **Per-project default scope:** teams can pre-set the default scope for a project by setting `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` in `.claude/settings.json`. See [Customization § Per-Project Default Scope](13-customization.md#per-project-default-scope).

<!-- END scope-stage-matrix -->

A ✓ marks static scope membership — it means the stage is included in the scope's plan, not that it will unconditionally execute. CONDITIONAL stages may be skipped at runtime when their condition does not hold (for example, Reverse Engineering only runs for brownfield projects), and pending stages can be reshaped through an approved composer proposal (see [the composer](#the-adaptive-composer)). Composed (custom) scopes are not listed here — their grids live in `scope-grid.json` alongside the stock ones.

## Auto-Detection from Freeform Intent

You don't have to specify a scope explicitly. Describe what you want, and the orchestrator detects the appropriate scope from keywords:

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

The engine analyzes your intent against keyword patterns:

| Keywords | Detected Scope |
|----------|---------------|
| "fix", "bug", "broken" | `bugfix` |
| "refactor", "clean up", "simplify" | `refactor` |
| "infrastructure", "deploy", "infra" | `infra` |
| "security", "CVE", "vulnerability", "patch" | `security-patch` |
| "proof of concept", "prototype", "poc", "spike" | `poc` |
| "mvp", "minimum viable" | `mvp` |
| "workshop", "lab", "training" | `workshop` |
| "express", "lightweight" | `express` |
| Explicit low-context fallback | `feature` when core is enabled; otherwise the sole enabled plugin's first scope when unambiguous |

**Disambiguation rule:** Descriptions longer than five words normally receive the compose offer below. An affirmative match for `refactor`, `mvp`, `minimum viable`, `poc`, `proof of concept`, or `CVE` instead proposes the matching scope, regardless of length. For example, "refactor the legacy authentication module to improve maintainability" proposes `refactor`. Generic words such as `fix` and `deploy` alone still receive the compose offer.

The exemption checks every keyword, so "security vulnerability CVE-2026-12345" can identify `security-patch` even when `security` matches first. Nearby negation before a keyword, such as "do not refactor" or "not a proof of concept", does not activate the exemption; a later affirmative mention can still match. This is a lexical heuristic, so confirm that the proposed plan fits your intent. Among eligible scopes, the first alphabetical scope wins. Inputs of five words or fewer retain the existing alphabetical keyword matching. Plugin-specific keywords retain the length heuristic until plugins can declare their own keyword specificity.

After a clear keyword match, you get a one-line confirmation naming the MATCHED scope and the ceremony it carries, straight from the compiled grid:

```
Starting a "bugfix" workflow for: "fix login bug" - 8 of 33 stages, 5 approval gates. Confirm to proceed,
name a different scope, or say "compose" for a tailored plan.
```

Confirm to proceed, or reply with a different scope (or `compose`) to course-correct before the workflow starts.

---

## The Adaptive Composer

The underlying resolver's no-keyword default is `classic` (overridable with
`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE`), which is used by
explicit fallback paths and low-context utility calls. In the user-facing
cold-start flow, rich prose, no keyword hit, or a keyword buried in a long
description enters the compose offer before a workflow is created; it does not
silently start Feature. You can also force composition:

```
/aidlc compose "harden the deployment pipeline and add observability"
/aidlc-compose "same thing, as a typeable shortcut"
/aidlc compose --report sonar.json     # compose from a scan report
/aidlc --new-scope "..."               # force a custom scope even on a stock match
```

The composer agent reads your task, then estimates five implementation-entropy components - intent ambiguity, codebase structural uncertainty, verification entropy, risk, and unresolved assumptions - and composes the minimum viable workflow: the least sufficient EXECUTE/SKIP grid that still produces every artifact the outcome depends on. Structural estimates ground in CodeKB MCP call-graph and component analysis when a CodeKB server is configured and indexed (an optional external tool; nothing ships with AI-DLC); otherwise the composer falls back to the bounded workspace scan (brownfield/greenfield, languages). The proposal you see at the gate carries the score breakdown (each component with a LOW/MED/HIGH band and its evidence), an advisory composite, and a per-stage decision table with a reason for every EXECUTE and SKIP. You approve, edit, or reject; nothing is written and no workflow starts before an explicit approval. On approve:

- If the proposal MATCHED a stock scope, AI-DLC creates the workflow with that scope directly (a scan report full of code-level findings usually routes to `bugfix` or `security-patch` this way).
- For a CUSTOM grid, the composer authors a real scope (a `scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` plus a `scope-grid.json` entry) and AI-DLC creates the workflow with it in the same turn. The composed scope resolves like any stock scope afterwards (`/aidlc --scope <name>`), and it survives a graph recompile: `aidlc engine graph compile` folds composed grid entries back into the regenerated `scope-grid.json` rather than rebuilding the grid from stage frontmatter alone. It also survives an engine reinstall and travels between harnesses — see [Where a composed scope is stored](#where-a-composed-scope-is-stored).
- Every front/report proposal carries a nonblank `creationDescription`. When the compose request included task text, it is that text verbatim; report-only and task-less proposals derive it from the approved findings/plan. The same-turn creation passes it after the literal `--` delimiter as one shell-safe argv value (POSIX single-quoted when rendered in a shell), so the state Project field and intent-record slug preserve descriptions that contain shell metacharacters or begin with a flag. A compose approval cannot continue with only a scope and no description.

**CodeKB grounding (optional):** CodeKB is an external MCP server that serves pre-computed structural analysis of a codebase (call graphs, component inventories, cross-package coupling). AI-DLC does not ship or require it - without it the composer scores structure from the bounded workspace scan, which is the normal path. When you do connect one, the composer uses it as the sole structural evidence source and cites it in the proposal (`method: codekb`). How to connect it depends on the harness: on Claude Code add the server to your project's `.mcp.json` (subagents inherit session MCP servers); on Codex add an `mcp_servers` entry to your `config.toml`; on opencode add it to your opencode config; on Copilot CLI add it to `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, and in VS Code to `.vscode/mcp.json`. On Kiro CLI the shipped composer config sets `includeMcpJson: true`, so connecting CodeKB means adding it to `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` without `"disabled": true` and adding its `@<server>` grant to the composer agent's `tools`; Kiro IDE remains fallback-only. Do not confuse CodeKB with the framework's own "codekb" directory (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/codekb/`) - that is the local artifact store the Reverse Engineering stage writes, unrelated to the MCP server. Note that with CodeKB evidence the composer may propose skipping Reverse Engineering; the proposal must disclose that downstream stages then run without that local store, and you decide at the gate.

The composer is not the only consumer: **Reverse Engineering (2.1) also prefers CodeKB.** When the server is reachable and its readiness gate passes for a repo (an indexed space that maps to the repo, non-zero components covering the scan's paths, and an index that is current for it), CodeKB *replaces* that repo's code scan — the developer link queries the index instead of reading source, grepping, or walking directories, and only reads the files CodeKB does not serve (dependency/build manifests, lockfiles, CI/lint/coverage config, README) to keep `technology-stack.md`, `dependencies.md`, and `code-quality-assessment.md` factual. If any gate check fails — including a stale index — that repo silently falls back to the ordinary filesystem scan, so nothing breaks when CodeKB is absent, disabled, or not granted. The decision is per repo, the two sources are never blended, and `reverse-engineering-timestamp.md` plus the stage's completion summary record which source produced each store (and which gate check failed when a reachable CodeKB was not used). Everything else about the stage is unchanged: the store freshness guard, both pipeline receipts, the locked all-artifact publish, and your approval gate. On Kiro CLI the developer and architect personas need the same `@<server>` grant in their `tools` lists that the composer needs.

**Keyword hygiene:** composed scopes ship with `keywords: []`, so a one-off plan never participates in keyword auto-detection. Making a composed scope inferable for future prompts is an explicit question at the gate, never a side effect.

**In-flight recompose:** mid-workflow, `/aidlc compose` proposes re-shaping the PENDING stages of the running workflow - skip what you no longer need, add back a pending stage you realize you need. The composer re-estimates the entropy components from what completed stages actually resolved, so each proposed flip names the evidence that moved the score ("feasibility settled the integration questions - risk re-scores MED"). Flips apply only to pending, ahead-of-cursor stages (completed and in-progress stages are frozen), are strict-validated so no remaining stage is starved of a required input, and land through the deterministic `recompose` verb under the audit lock with a `RECOMPOSED` audit event. The first EXECUTE stage of Construction (the walking-skeleton gate anchor) cannot be flipped.

You do not need the literal verb: plain chat like "can we skip market research? we already know this market" is recognized mid-workflow as a reshape request and routed through the same gate and the same `recompose` verb. When you name the stages yourself ("drop market-research and team-formation"), the conductor may present the gate directly without dispatching the composer agent - the approval gate and the validation are identical either way. On the non-Claude harnesses the literal `/aidlc compose "<request>"` verb remains the documented reliable path.

### Where a composed scope is stored

A stock scope belongs to the engine: it is regenerated into the harness tree on every build. A composed scope is *yours* — nothing in the engine produces it — so it is stored with the rest of your work:

| | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Record** | `aidlc/scopes/<name>.md` | The durable source. Your scope file, plus a generated grid region holding the EXECUTE/SKIP plan, in one file. Commit it with the rest of your `aidlc/` tree |
| **Projection** | `<harness>/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` + a `scope-grid.json` column | What the runtime reads. Regenerated from the record by `aidlc engine graph compile` |

Two things follow, both of which used to fail:

- **An engine reinstall cannot lose the scope.** Replacing the harness tree discards the projection; the next `graph compile` rebuilds it from the record. This matters for the copy channel in particular, where `scope-grid.json` is a generated file that any copy-over replaces.
- **A composed scope travels between harnesses.** The record lives in the shared, tool-neutral `aidlc/` tree, so a collaborator working in `.kiro/` or `.codex/` resolves a scope you composed in `.claude/` after one `graph compile`.

If you have a composed scope from an earlier release it lives only in the harness tree; the first `graph compile` after upgrading writes its record for you, once. From then on the record is the source.

#### The record's shape

Everything above the sentinel comment is yours to edit — frontmatter and prose alike, including your own Markdown headings and fenced code. Everything between the sentinels is generated. Treat the region as the **end** of the file: write your prose above it, because that is the part `graph compile` projects into the harness tree. Anything you append *below* the END sentinel stays in the record — nothing rewrites a record that already exists — but it is not carried into the harness scope file:

````markdown
---
name: my-lean-feature
depth: Standard
keywords: []
---

# my-lean-feature

Whatever you want to write, including a "## Stage Grid" heading of your own.

<!-- BEGIN aidlc composed-scope-grid: generated by `aidlc engine graph compile` — reshape the plan through /aidlc compose, not by editing here -->

```json
{ "stages": { "intent-capture": "EXECUTE", "units-generation": "SKIP" } }
```

<!-- END aidlc composed-scope-grid -->
````

Reshape the plan with `/aidlc compose`, not by editing the region — a hand-edited grid is not validated against the stage graph, so it can starve a stage of an input it requires.

Editing the part above the sentinel is fine, but note that `graph compile` writes the harness scope file only when it is **missing**; it does not overwrite one you have edited. So if you change `depth` or `description` in the record, delete `<harness>/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` and recompile to re-project it. The plan itself always comes from the record, so this only affects descriptive fields.

#### When a record is unreadable

A record missing its frontmatter, its `name`, or its generated grid region **stops** `graph compile` and `aidlc update` with the file path and the required edit named — it is committed work, so it is never silently skipped. Repair the named file, or delete it: if the harness projection is still present, the next compile back-fills a fresh record from it. `/aidlc --doctor`'s **Composed scope durability** check reports a scope file with no grid column, a record that has not been projected yet, and a runnable workflow whose scope no longer resolves.

## The 3 Depth Levels

Depth controls the detail level of artifacts produced at each stage. The scope sets a default depth, but you can override it.

| Depth | Artifact Detail | When to Use |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Core essentials only. Short documents, key decisions, minimal supporting analysis. | Quick fixes, patches, proofs of concept |
| **Standard** | Balanced detail. Complete requirements, architecture decisions with rationale, thorough test plans. | Most features and MVPs |
| **Comprehensive** | Full enterprise detail. Exhaustive requirements, compliance matrices, detailed NFR specifications, complete audit documentation. | Regulated features, enterprise deployments |

### How depth affects stages

At each stage, the agent adjusts its output based on the active depth:

- **Minimal:** 1-2 page artifact, key decisions only, skip optional sections
- **Standard:** Complete artifact, all required sections, concise rationale
- **Comprehensive:** Expanded artifact, optional sections included, detailed justification, compliance cross-references

### Overriding depth

You can change the depth at three points:

1. **Via the `--depth` CLI flag** — override depth at invocation time:
   ```
   /aidlc --depth comprehensive
   /aidlc --scope bugfix --depth standard
   /aidlc --stage code-generation --depth minimal
   ```
2. **At scope confirmation** — when the orchestrator confirms the detected scope, reply with `--depth <level>` instead of just confirming
3. **At any approval gate** — request a different depth level as part of your feedback

The first completion message in each session reminds you:

```
**Project depth**: Standard — depth adapts artifact detail.
**Test strategy**: Standard — test strategy controls test volume.
You can request different depth or test strategy at any approval gate.
```

## Specifying Scope Directly

### Explicit scope

```
/aidlc feature
/aidlc bugfix
/aidlc enterprise
```

### Scope with description

```
/aidlc bugfix Fix the login timeout issue
/aidlc poc Build a quick prototype for the search feature
```

### Override scope with utility command

```
/aidlc --scope bugfix
/aidlc --scope enterprise --stage code-generation
```

The `--scope` flag is composable with `--stage`, `--phase`, and `--depth` for jump operations.

### Override depth

```
/aidlc --depth minimal
/aidlc --scope bugfix --depth comprehensive
/aidlc --scope enterprise --depth standard --stage code-generation
```

The `--depth` flag overrides the scope's default depth level. Valid values: `minimal`, `standard`, `comprehensive` (case-insensitive).

### Override test strategy

```
/aidlc --test-strategy minimal
/aidlc --depth standard --test-strategy minimal
```

The `--test-strategy` flag overrides the test strategy independently of depth. See the full explanation in [The 3 Test Strategy Levels](#the-3-test-strategy-levels) below.

---

## The 3 Test Strategy Levels

Test strategy controls **how many tests** are generated and **which test types** are included. It is independent of depth — depth controls artifact detail (documents, diagrams, questions), while test strategy controls test volume only. This separation lets you run a full Standard-depth workflow with Minimal testing when speed matters more than test coverage.

### Minimal — Nyquist model

Inspired by the Nyquist rate from signal processing: the minimum sampling frequency needed to reconstruct a signal. Minimal test strategy generates the minimum tests needed to verify every requirement — no more, no less.

- **1 test per identified requirement** (requirement-driven, not component-driven)
- **Happy-path floor:** every component gets at least 1 happy-path unit test, even if no requirement maps to it
- **Unit tests by default.** A bugfix/security-patch targeted regression may
  use integration or E2E when that is the narrowest level that reproduces the
  defect; unrelated test volume remains Minimal.
- **~5-15 tests total** for a typical project
- Soft guideline — the agent can exceed when safety-critical context demands it

**Best for:** Workshops, training sessions, proofs of concept, quick bugfixes — any context where you want to verify correctness without investing in a full test suite.

### Standard — per-component model

Balanced test coverage that validates boundaries between components.

- **5-8 tests per component**
- **Unit + integration tests** (key boundaries between components)
- E2E, performance, and security tests only if NFR requirements explicitly call for them
- **Test pyramid proportions:** ~75% unit / ~20% integration / ~5% E2E
- Soft guideline

**Best for:** Most features and MVPs — good coverage without over-investing in testing.

### Comprehensive — full coverage model

Thorough test coverage across all test types.

- **10-15 tests per component**
- **All test types:** unit + integration + E2E + performance (if NFRs exist) + security (if NFRs exist)
- **Test pyramid proportions** apply across all types
- Soft guideline

**Best for:** Enterprise features, regulated systems, any context requiring an audit trail of test coverage.

### How test strategy defaults work

Most core scopes inherit test strategy from depth. `classic` therefore uses the
production Standard test floor and `express` uses the requirement-driven Minimal
floor. `workshop` retains its explicit Minimal override at Standard depth for
teaching sessions. You can always override with `--test-strategy`.

### Overriding test strategy

You can change the test strategy at three points:

1. **Via the `--test-strategy` CLI flag** — override at invocation time:
   ```
   /aidlc --test-strategy minimal
   /aidlc --depth standard --test-strategy minimal
   /aidlc --scope bugfix --test-strategy comprehensive
   ```
2. **Mid-workflow** — change test strategy on an active workflow:
   ```
   /aidlc --test-strategy comprehensive
   ```
3. **At any approval gate** — request a different test strategy as part of your feedback

### Common depth + test strategy combinations

| Depth | Test Strategy | Effect | When to use |
|-------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Standard | Standard | Full artifacts, balanced tests | Feature, classic, and other production scopes |
| Standard | Minimal | Full artifacts, Nyquist tests | Workshops, time-boxed sessions |
| Minimal | Minimal | Lean artifacts, requirement-driven tests | Express, quick bugfixes, patches |
| Comprehensive | Comprehensive | Full everything | Regulated enterprise features |
| Comprehensive | Standard | Full artifacts, balanced tests | Enterprise with pragmatic testing |
| Minimal | Comprehensive | Lean artifacts, thorough tests | Critical bugfix needing confidence |

## Choosing the Right Scope

| Situation | Recommended Scope |
|-----------|------------------|
| New feature for a production application | `feature` |
| Greenfield product from scratch | `mvp` or `feature` |
| Quick validation of an approach | `poc` |
| Known bug to fix | `bugfix` |
| Code cleanup without behavior changes | `refactor` |
| New AWS environment or CDK changes | `infra` |
| CVE or security vulnerability response | `security-patch` |
| Regulated feature requiring compliance | `enterprise` |
| V1-style Inception + Construction with minimal ceremony | `classic` |
| Lightweight requirements-to-deploy run | `express` |
| AI-DLC workshop or training lab | `workshop` |

When in doubt, start with `feature` for full-lifecycle coverage; choose `classic` for the v1-style Inception and Construction experience without Ideation or Operation.
